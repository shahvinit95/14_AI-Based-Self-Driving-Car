# Brief Description
The basic idea behind the project is to develop an automated car that is capable of sensing
its environment and moving without any human input. The automation will be achieved
by detecting lane marking, signals, obstacles, stop sign using image processing and neural
network to react and take decisions such as changing the course of the car, stopping on stop
signs and red signal, and moving on green signal. Self-driving car processes inputs, plots a
path, and sends instructions to the vehicle’s actuators, which control acceleration, braking,
and steering. Hard-coded rules, obstacle avoidance algorithms, predictive modeling, and
“smart” object discrimination help the software follow traffic rules and navigate obstacles.
A monocular vision-based self-driving car prototype using Deep Neural Network on Raspberry Pi is proposed. Self-driving cars are one of the most increasing interests in recent
years as the definitely developing relevant hardware and software technologies toward fully
autonomous driving capability with no human intervention. Level-3/4 autonomous vehicles
are potentially turning into a reality in near future. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
have been shown to achieve significant performance in various perception and control tasks in
comparison to other techniques in the latest years. The key factors behind these impressive
results are their ability to learn millions of parameters using a large amount of labeled data.
In this work, we concentrate on finding a model that directly maps raw input images to a
predicted steering angle as output using a deep neural network. The technical contributions
of this work are two-fold.
